## code-experiments
 - Miscellaneous sections of code written for experiments
 - This repository contains any sections of code I wrote and found interesting, but didn't fit into any other repository, or warrant its own
 - Most of this is just code written in class for my A-Levels
 - I don't plan to maintain this, it's mostly just a code dump, in case anyone finds any use out of it
