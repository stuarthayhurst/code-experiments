## code-experiments
 - Miscellaneous sections of code written for experiments
   - Basically anything that doesn't have a home in my other projects, or warrant its own repository
 - Most of this is just code written in class for my A-Levels
 - I don't plan to maintain this, it's mostly just a code dump, in case anyone finds any use out of it
