## code-experiments
  - Miscellaneous sections of code written for experiments
    - Basically anything that doesn't have a home in my other projects, or warrant its own repository
  - Most of this is just code written in class for my A-Levels
  - I don't plan to maintain this, it's mostly just a code dump, in case anyone finds any use out of it
    - The commit dates don't necessarily reflect the modification date, as many scripts were dumped into this repo at the same time
